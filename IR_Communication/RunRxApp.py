This python code ....
1.  Receives 38 kHz IR signal from  IR LED Sensor connected to RPi GPIO.
2.  Decode the bit stream into data-packet.
3.  The data-packet contains 4 bytes packet signature, 1 byte data length,
    4 bytes data, and checksum bit. The data is decoded for data exchange
    and drone control commnds.

@ input: IR signal
@ output: command signal
